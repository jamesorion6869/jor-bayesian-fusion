# jor-bayesian-fusion
Evidence-driven fusion of SOP, NHP, and Bayesian inference for UAP case evaluation

## Overview
This repository contains the James Orion Report (JOR) Bayesian Fusion framework, which combines Solid Object Probability (SOP), Non-Human Probability (NHP), and Bayesian updating to rigorously evaluate UAP (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) cases. The framework ensures that confidence in non-human explanations grows only when evidence is strong, consistent, and well-documented.

## Contents
- `jor_bayesian_fusion.pdf` — the full report with case studies
- `README.md` — this file

## Usage
This repository is intended for academic and research purposes. The report can be referenced and cited in studies on UAP evaluation methodology. Future work may include automation using probabilistic programming frameworks like PyMC.
