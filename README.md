# jor-bayesian-fusion
Evidence-driven fusion of SOP, NHP, and Bayesian inference for UAP case evaluation

## Overview
This repository contains the James Orion Report (JOR) Bayesian Fusion framework, which integrates Solid Object Probability (SOP), Non-Human Probability (NHP), and Bayesian updating to rigorously evaluate UAP (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) cases.

The framework is explicitly evidence-first: confidence in non-human explanations is permitted to grow **only when the physical and observational evidence supports the presence of a genuine, well-characterized object**. While SOP and NHP are computed independently, interpretive logic constrains NHP by the evidentiary strength established through SOP, preventing misclassification of ambiguous or poorly supported cases.

## Contents
- `jor_bayesian_fusion.pdf` — the full report, including methodology and case studies
- `README.md` — this file

## Usage
This repository is intended for academic and research purposes. The framework is designed for structured case evaluation, comparison, and methodological analysis—not automated classification or claim-making.

The report may be referenced and cited in studies related to UAP analysis, uncertainty quantification, or evidence-weighted inference. Future work may explore partial automation using probabilistic programming frameworks (e.g., PyMC), while preserving human oversight in evidentiary scoring.
